# flappy-ai

A small fun site where users can play the game flappy bird or train an AI to do so for them.

the AI is trained using the a genetic algorithm. Basically birds that do well have higher chance to pass their genes to the next generation.

genes in this context are variables in a linear equation that tell the bird when to jump.

This project was made with PUG nodejs and vanilla Javascript.
